# DEPRECATED!  ttoks.txt is deprecated because it doesn't really do anything
# all that useful.  See toks.txt for a list of tokens, maybe, if I feel like
# it.
#
# ttoks.txt contains only basic tokens that are (1) easily matched and
# (2) apply to the default state of the scanner for Tetra.
# ttoks.txt consists of records separated by blank lines, with fields
# separated by newlines.  The first field gives the token's name, and the
# second and subsequent fields give the regular expressions that match
# the token.  If a record has but one field, then it has a corresponding
# token to be generated by mktoks.awk, but will be ignored by mkscan.awk
# Comments must begin on their own line, beginning with a hash, and
# continuing until the end of the line.
